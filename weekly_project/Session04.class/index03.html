        <p>30</p>
        <p>30</p>
        <p>30</p>

          1.8 The answers for 1.5-1.7 are the same, after my research, I found that in JavaScript,
          functions are "hoisted" to the top of their scope. This means that even if you call a function
          before it is defined, the JavaScript engine knows that it will be defined later in the code,
          so it allows the call to go through. This is why it is possible to call a function before it
          is defined in JavaScript. The function definition is processed first by the JavaScript engine,
          and then the rest of the code is executed. This allows you to use a function before it is defined,
          even if it is called before its declaration.
        </p>

        <h4>Part 1b: Functions with two arguments and no return value</h4>
        <p>30. Although there's no arguments passed, but the p1 and p2 are defined inside the function, so the function will always print 30 unless we use the passed variables a and b.</p>
        <p>30. As above.</p>
        <p>30. The arguments 5 and 6 were passed to the function for calculation and printing.</p>

        <h4>Part 1c: Functions with two arguments and one return value</h4>
        <p>We need to use a variable to store the result and then print it. Because without the console.log(answer), the function will just return the result but not actually used.</p>

        <h4>Part 3: Variable scope</h4>
        <h5>Line 1 and Line 2 are in current position:</h5>
        <p>


          Post-function block: counter2's value is: 5<br>
          Inside the function block: counter2's value is: 6<br><br>

          counter2 is defined outside the function and assigned with 5. But only before using the counter2 inside the function, it is increased by 1.
        </p>

        <h5>Line 2 is inside function block BEFORE “counter2 = counter2+1” expression:</h5>
        <p>
          Post-function block: counter2's value is: undefined<br>
          Inside the function block: counter2's value is: 6<br><br>

          counter2 is only defined inside the function and assigned with 5. But before using the counter2, it is increased by 1.

        </p>

        <h5>Line 2 is inside function block AFTER “counter2 = counter2+1” expression:</h5>
        <p>
          Post-function block: counter2's value is: undefined<br>
          Inside the function block: counter2's value is: 5<br><br>

          counter2 is only defined inside the function, and also 5 is assigned finally before the counter2 is used.

        </p>

        <h5>Line 2 is in post-function block, after function call:</h5>
        <p>
          Post-function block: counter2's value is: undefined<br>
          Inside the function block: counter2's value is: NaN<br><br>

          counter 2 is not defined inside the function, so the result is NaN. And counter2 is only defined outside the function but not initialized, so the result is undefined.
