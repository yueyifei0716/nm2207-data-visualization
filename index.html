        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
			Social media has become an increasingly popular tool for communication and self-expression, but
			research has also suggested that excessive social media use can have negative effects on mental
			health. Studies have found links between high levels of social media use and increased rates of
			anxiety, depression, and loneliness, as well as poor sleep quality, low self-esteem, and social
			comparison. While not all social media use is harmful, it's important for individuals to be mindful
			of their social media habits and the potential impact on their mental health.
		</p>
		<div id="image-container"></div>
		<p>
			Based on the aforementioned background, it's clear that there is a need for further exploration of
			the relationship between social media usage and mental health. This is where data visualization comes
			in as a powerful tool for presenting complex information in a way that is easy to understand and interpret.
			By analyzing survey data related to social media use and mental health, we can gain a deeper understanding
			of the potential effects of social media on mental health and wellbeing. The data visualization section of
			this website will present the findings of the survey data, using various visualization techniques to highlight
			key patterns and trends in the data.

        <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>Let's look at the impact of using social media or not, here are some survey data from a survey</p>
		<div id="canvas-pie">
			<canvas id="gender"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>
			The pie chart shows the distribution of male and female respondents who completed a survey. The chart is divided
			into two segments, one for males and one for females. The size of each segment corresponds to the number of
			respondents in each group. In this particular survey, there were 208 male respondents and 259 female respondents.
			The segment for males is colored blue, and the segment for females is colored red. When the user hovers over a segment,
			it is offset from the center of the chart by a small distance to provide a visual cue. The chart title displays the total
			number of male and female respondents in the survey, which is 467.
		</p>
		<div id="canvas-bar">
			<canvas id="time-spent-chart"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>
			The bar chart shows the amount of time that survey respondents spent on social media in intervals of less than an hour
			up to more than five hours. The x-axis lists these time intervals, while the y-axis represents the number of respondents
			in each interval. The bars in the chart represent the number of survey respondents who reported spending the corresponding
			amount of time on social media. The height of each bar corresponds to the number of respondents in each time interval.
		</p>
		<p>
			According to the collected data, 33 respondents reported spending less than an hour on social media, while 69 respondents
			reported spending between 1 and 2 hours on social media. Similarly, 96 respondents reported spending between 2 and 3 hours
			on social media, 92 respondents reported spending between 3 and 4 hours, 65 respondents reported spending between 4 and 5 hours
			, and 112 respondents reported spending more than 5 hours on social media.

			Firstly, we are examining the relationship between gender and the extent to which individuals are bothered by worries after using
			social media. From the bar chart, we can observe that the patterns of worry among males and females are similar, but to some extent,
			males may experience more evenly distributed levels of worry, whereas females may be more susceptible to worry caused by social media.
		</p>
		<div id="canvas-bar">
			<canvas id="my_chart_1" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>
			Next, we are investigating the relationship between sleep issues and the amount of time spent on social media. The severity of
			sleep issues is based on users' self-evaluation, with higher levels indicating more severe sleep problems. From the graph, it
			is evident that users who spend less than 1 hour on social media are significantly less likely to experience sleep issues.
			Additionally, we can observe that the shorter the amount of time spent on social media, the lower the severity of sleep issues.
			However, when the time spent on social media exceeds 5 hours, the proportion of users with severe sleep problems noticeably increases.
		</p>
		<div id="canvas-bar">
			<canvas id="my_chart_2" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>
			Furthermore, we are examining the relationship between users' levels of distraction and the amount of time spent on social media.
			The severity of distraction is based on users' self-evaluation, with higher levels indicating greater levels of distraction.
			From the graph, it is evident that users who spend less than 1 hour on social media are significantly less likely to experience distraction.
			However, users who spend between 2 and 5 hours on social media appear to commonly experience distraction, with similar proportions of severity.
			Nevertheless, users who spend more than 5 hours on social media are noticeably more prone to distraction, as indicated by the higher
			proportions of Level 3, 4, and 5.
		</p>
		<div id="canvas-bar">
			<canvas id="my_chart_3" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>
			Lastly, we investigated the relationship between difficulty concentrating and the amount of time spent on social media. From the graph,
			it is evident that users who spend less than 1 hour on social media are significantly less likely to experience difficulty concentrating.
			However, interestingly, a large majority of users who spend between 1 and 4 hours on social media experience moderate difficulty
			concentrating, even more so than users who spend between 4 and 5 hours on social media. Nonetheless, users who spend more time on
			social media, such as over 5 hours, are more prone to severe difficulty concentrating.

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
			In conclusion, our research shows that there are clear relationships between social media use and various psychological issues.
			Users who spend less than 1 hour on social media tend to experience less worries, sleep problems, and difficulty concentrating.
			However, as the amount of time spent on social media increases, these issues become more prevalent and severe, particularly for
			female users who are more susceptible to worries. While users who spend between 1 and 4 hours on social media tend to have the
			highest prevalence of moderate psychological issues, users who spend over 5 hours are at the highest risk for severe problems.
			Therefore, it is important to be mindful of our social media use and to limit our exposure to reduce the negative
			impact on our mental health.
